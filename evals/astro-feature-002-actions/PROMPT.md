Implement the contact form on the contact page (`src/pages/contact.astro`) using Astro Actions. Define the action in `src/actions/index.ts` with server-side Zod validation for the `name` and `message` fields (both required strings). The action should accept form data and include a handler that processes the submission. Wire the contact page form to use the action.

**Note:** Before starting, if the Astro Docs MCP server is available, use it to look up the official docs and confirm the correct and up-to-date installation steps and API usage.
