Set up Content Collections for the blog posts in `src/content/blog/` using the Astro v5 Content Layer API. Define the collection config in `src/content.config.ts` with a glob loader and a Zod schema that validates the `title` (string) and `pubDate` (date) frontmatter fields. Then implement the blog listing page at `src/pages/blog/index.astro` that queries all posts, sorts them by date (newest first), and displays each post's title and publication date.

**Note:** Before starting, if the Astro Docs MCP server is available, use it to look up the official docs and confirm the correct and up-to-date installation steps and API usage.
