Add Tailwind CSS v4 to this Astro project using the recommended `@tailwindcss/vite` plugin approach (do not use the legacy `@astrojs/tailwind` integration). Set up a CSS file that imports Tailwind and make sure it is imported in the layout or page so that Tailwind classes are available throughout the site. Then, style the header on the index page using Tailwind utility classes — apply background color (`bg-`), text color (`text-`), padding (`p-`/`px-`/`py-`), and font styling (`font-`) to the header and its contents.

**Note:** Before starting, if the Astro Docs MCP server is available, use it to look up the official docs and confirm the correct and up-to-date installation steps and API usage.
