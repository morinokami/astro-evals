Add Tailwind CSS v4 to this Astro project (do not use the legacy `@astrojs/tailwind` integration). Set up a CSS file that imports Tailwind and make sure it is imported in the layout or page. Then, style the header on the index page using Tailwind utility classes — apply background color, text color, padding, and font styling to the header and its contents.

**Note:** Before starting, if the Astro Docs MCP server is available, use it to look up the official docs and confirm the correct and up-to-date installation steps and API usage.
