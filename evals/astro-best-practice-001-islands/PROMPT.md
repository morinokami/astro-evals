Implement the ProductList component in src/components/ProductList.astro to display a list of products with their name and price. Each product should also have an interactive "Add to Favorites" button using the FavoriteButton component in src/components/FavoriteButton.tsx. Follow the existing patterns in this codebase.

**Note:** Before starting, if the Astro Docs MCP server is available, use it to look up the official docs and confirm the correct and up-to-date installation steps and API usage.
